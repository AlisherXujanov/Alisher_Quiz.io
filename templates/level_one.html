    <p>The treasure hunter made his way to an uninhabited island in the Caribbean using an old map. 
        He wandered for several hours in the dense tropics, untill he came across a tribe of local Aborigens. 
        The tribal elder decided to kill the intruder immediately, but first decided to mock him. 
        The treasure hunter could only say the last phrase in his life. If it turns out to be true, 
        then he will be thrown from the mountain onto rocky shore. If the phrase turns out to be lie, 
        the wanderer will be torn apart by lions. However, the treasur hunter managed to escape.
